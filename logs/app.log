2025-09-07 09:44:26 - CrimeAgent-AgentExecutor - INFO - Agent Response:I see - a fraternity party can definitely create significant noise disturbances. This helps me understand the situation better.

A few quick questions to document this properly:

1. **What time did the party start** and how long has it been going on?

2. **What specific noises** are you hearing - loud music, shouting, people outside, or all of the above?

3. **Is this affecting your ability to sleep** or causing other disruptions?

Once I have these details, I can help you determine the best approach - whether this needs immediate police response or if we should start with a formal noise complaint through your local authorities.
